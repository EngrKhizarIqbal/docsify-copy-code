# docsify-copy-code

A docsify plugin that adds a button to easily copy code blocks to your clipboard.

## Usage

Assuming you have a working [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) app set up, it is easy to use this plugin.

### Add script

Add the following `script` tag to your `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Latest -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/docsify-copy-code/index.js"></script>
```

Again, you can also specify a specific version if you want to:

```html
<!-- Latest 2.x -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/docsify-copy-code/index.js@2"></script>
```

That is it! If all went well, any preformatted code should now have a `Click to copy!` link on hover.
